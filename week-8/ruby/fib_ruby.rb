# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# This challenge took me [#] hours.

# Pseudocode
# square root number to get clocest sequence length
# run fibonacci sequence
    # store 2 values before sqrt of number and 2 values after sqrt of number
# compare input to sequence


# Initial Solution
