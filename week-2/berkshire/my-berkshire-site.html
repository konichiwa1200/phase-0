<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Ok. Its a great way to determine the construction of websites. I like reverse engineering. So it went well.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	Google is your friend and it worked great. The only slight challenge is that you have to learn the vocabulary of html and that sometimes can be a challenge because you might not know that something exists until someone tells your or you stumble upon it during the investigation process.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	Good until it came to the unordered lists which required to have some styling or there would be margin padding that interfered with the reconstruction. Everything else was fairly straight forward.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	The more I learn about html, the more that I find that things were thought about. Just like legos, you can build anything, it just depends on how much time you want to put to create it.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Use a text editor which has much of the vocabulary that you need. Its just your job to know what each word means, just like Word has a built in dictionary, its the job of the writter to use the appropriate words to convey an idea or thought.
