<!-- 
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
	- get the file path correctly, otherwise the browser will not be able to render it because it can't find it.
What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
	- When in doubt, use a <div> tag to be able to position the element the way you want. The biggest challenge has been to learn the properties of attributes and what do they do. Chrome dev tools really help with intelisense to autocomplete.
What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
	- Primarily it was font-color, font-size, and text-align. 
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
	- We chose to use classes because they are more broad and can apply to more than one tag that need the same formatting. But id's can be used great when performing data scrapping.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
	- The actual code was in tabular form, and not HtML5 compliant. The doctype file states html4, and when you enter into W3C markup validation tool, 9+ errors are flagged. Our code only gets two warnings due to a lack of heading for the sections. Thus our code follows better practices than the official pages.
