What are methods? Why are they useful?
They are blocks of code that can be challed when you need to perform the same code more than once. Its to prevent the repetition of code. Why write the same code twice, when a method can be called and perform the task.

What are local variables? Where are they able to be accessed (HINT: try accessing a local variable outside of a method to see). 
Local variables are variables with a scope limited to the block of code from where they were initiated from. 

What is a method's argument? How would you use that?
These are the method's inputs, if some are need, which will be used to produce the desired output. We first declare how many arguments the method needs by using paranthesis after the method's name, separating each argument with comman. Then each argument is passed into the method as an initialized variable; from there, we can use it like any other variable. 

How does Ruby know what to return in a method?
By default, it returns the last line of code in a ruby file, but we can also uset the `return` keyword to return the value of an argument or expression that is not the last line of code in the file.

What does it mean to iterate (or loop) over arrays or hashes? 
It means to perform the code inside the loop to every element, which meets the criteria specified, in the array/hash. 

What new Ruby methods did you learn about in this challenge?
the `.reduce(:x)`, where x is a mathematical operator, function on an array.
the `.join(x)`, where x is a character or string of characters, function on an array.

What did you learn from your pair in this challenge?
Being prepared with the right environment right of the bat really makes things go smoother. I was unprepared with how to code and collaborate real-time and that was a weakness during the challenge. I also learned that the pseudocode challenge was really difficult because the challenges in 4.7 where not complex enough to warrant pseudocode and as result, we ended up delving right into code.
