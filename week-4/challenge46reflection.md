-What does it mean to iterate over an array?
It means to go through the entire array element by element and perform the same code to each element. Depending on the code, there can be a variety of results from simple printouts to a single element.
-How are arrays structured? What can they contain? 
It is a collection of objects. They can contain any combination of objects.
-Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?
By passing the key to the hash, the value will be returned
-What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?
All keys must be unique. As a result, there can't be any dublicate key value pairs. And if there are two different hashes that store the same key/value pair, they will be pointing to the same object in memory.
-What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?
Arrays are great at storing data that you would store in variable, since most if not all of the things that you can do with a variable, you can do with an array. Hence, I would really describe an array as a collection of variables. Hashes on the other hand, are key value pairs where you only want one key associated with one value; multiple keys can have the same value, but no key can have more than one value.
