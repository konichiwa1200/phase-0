    <h3>Benefits of Version Control</h3>
    <p>
      Version control grants us the ability to track changes as a project progresses. In addition, along with the tracking ability, there is also a note taking process that allows for clarity. As a change is performed in the code and tracked by version control, standard good practice dictates the need for descriptive comments to accompany the changes; these comments might result useful in future investigative debugging efforts if committed changes create unwanted or unintended conflicts to a working project. Thus as a result, commit in version control is similar to a snapshot in Apple's time machine, which allows developers to go back in time and see the changes and comments.   
    </p>
    <h3>Git and Tracking</h3>
    <p>Git is software that makes keeping track of code changes easy. The idea is that everyone that is working on a project has a local copy of the entire project, and they stay synchronized to a central repository where the owner of the repository approves or declines changes that are submitted by developers working on the project. Git also assists in displaying conflicts in code that arise in the same file. The way it functions is simple: there is a master branch; a state of the project where everyone goes and copies the latest edition of the project. This is like going to the bookstore and buying a book called "Book master edition". Then you go home and read it, making changes where you think it would make sense. These changes can be additions, deletions, rearrangements, etc. When you think you made a nice contribution, you go back to the store and request the author of the book to look over your changes and add them to the book. THe author looks over the changes and determines whether to incorporate your changes, or not. If the author agrees to add the changes, it will then be published to the "Book master edition"; anyone that is also working on the book will want to go back to the store to get a copy of the most recent version of the book. If you deleted something and someone else added a new comment on the same page, Git will alert the owner that there are conflicting changes on a specific page and to please resolve them before the master edition can be updated.</p>
    <h3>The Use of GitHub</h3>
    <p>Github is a cloud based repository manager service that integrates extremely well with Git. Some benefits of this service is to maintain a remote backup of your project. Additionally, it serves as the central repository where poeple can go to pull the master branch. And finally, its free to use, with paid private repositories, thus allowing up and coming developers to display and craft a portfolio of projects to showcase the community at large.</p>

<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	- <p>, <h1>, <section>, and <div>
	- the p and h1 because they are where most of the content lives. Section has been used because it is more descriptive than a general div attached with a descriptive class or id. The general div has been used in other projet often because they are used extensively with bootstrap
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	- The layout and order in which the browser is raeds the tags is from top to bottom and left to right 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
	- its a well designed and versatile piece of software. 
	- As coding experience increases and projects increase, I do see a useful reason to create handy snippets to increase production and efficienty while I code
	- After watching a tutorial of sublime on some of the tricks that sublime has to offer, I do think that I will do more research on sublime to see what other hidden gems the software holds.
