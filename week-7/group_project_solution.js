// tests for sum
// 
As a user, I want to make sure that sum is a function with numeric input and output. I want to determine the length of the input and classify it as an even or odd number.


// tests for mean
Mean is an equation for adding up all numbers in the array and dividing that sun by the number of numbers. The mean equations should be applied to both the even and odd arrays.

// tests for median
As a user I would like to find the median value of the even and odd data sets. The median is also the number that is halfway into the set. To find the median, the data should first be arranged in order from least to greatest. To remember the definition of a median, just think of the median of a road, which is the middlemost part of the road.
