<p>Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?<br />
<ul>
<li>I got a refresher on the history of javascript. Every time I see javascript, it reminds be of java, but with the background provided in the introduction, I was reminded that it was influenced by java. Only influenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?</p>
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Strings are stored the same way, with quotation marks. 2. Arithmatic follows the same order of operations</li>
<li>1. All numbers of 64-bit floats. 2. Javascript will do automatic type conversion in order to return a value, even when inputs don't make sense</li>
</ul>
<p>What is an expression?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Block of code</li>
</ul>
What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?<br />
 <ul>
<li>End an expression. Yes</li>
</ul>
What causes a variable to return undefined?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Variable creating with no value assignment</li>
</ul>
Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.<br />
 <ul>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Prints argument to browser built-in console</li>
<li>Use log method on console and pass an argument</li>
<li>print, puts, p</li>
</ul>
Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.<br />
 <ul>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
Describe while and for loops<br />
 <ul>
<li>While tests a condition and executes a block of code as long as the condition is met</li>
<li>For loops execute a block of code as long as an argument is valid. Typically used when you know how many times you want the loop to execute.</li>
</ul>
What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Javascript is very Java syntax friendly, while Ruby is very Python syntax friendly.</li>
</ul>
Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.</p>
 <ul>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
When should you use functions?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
What is a function declaration?<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.</p>
 <ul>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
<p>Skip the sections on the Lycanthrope's log, Computing Correlations, and sections from Further Arrayology to the Global Object, but read the chapter summary.<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.<br />
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?</p>
 <ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>
