<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!--

What did you learn about the DOM?
The more I work with the DOM, the more the language seems structured. Yet, the lack of some intellisense to guide new devs on the console sometimes makes it difficult. Chrome Dev Tools does a decent job, but inconsistant with auto complete.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
The use of getElementById is the first option that gets triggered by intellisense, thus it denotes the prevelant use of ID in DOM tags. Additionally, appendChild, removeChild, and 'element'.innerHTML are the most frequent commands that I have used thus far.
